# wtf
A tool that integrates github commit and PR comment threads into your dev loop via an easy to use CLI.

## wtf is wtf
I love github, and I love talking about code with my team in github projects. However, I have noticed that those conversations
seem to get lost in the sands of time. It would be nice to be able to easily see historical comment threads about a project or 
even a specific file. It would be even nicer to leave comments about code or a specific github PR in your terminal as you are
diving through the code. That is the goal of wtf.
